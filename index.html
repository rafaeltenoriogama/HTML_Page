    <h1 id="1">Objectives:</h1>
    <p>
      Make a web page using pure HTMl and maybe some "style" including
      specifically inside the tags, not in sort of "css/style.css" using HREF.
    </p>

    <h2 id="2">Who am I?</h2>

      I'm Rafael Tenorio Gama, a graduate of IT Management from
      <i> Faculdade de Tecnologia de SÃ£o Paulo</i>.

      I haved work on Linux Servers like: Ubuntu, RedHat and CentOS. Recently,
      using more of Windows Server 2008 for data server and Windows Server 2022
      for remote server on company
      <strong>Ambiental Transportes Urbanos S/A</strong>
    </p>

    <h2 id="3">Why I do this HTML course on DIO?</h2>
    <p>
      I usually work on <strong>Django Web</strong> projects, which is a
      framework that works on <strong>Python language.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only that, but work in a team which use some projects with
      <i>low code architecture</i> like <strong>scriptcase</strong> which using
      <strong>PHP</strong> as a base language.
    </p>

    <p>
      Both of them using HTML and even if I was working on the backend server
      programming language, I feel like just missing something, and wanna
      solidify this before move on on web development knowledge.

    <h2 id="initial">Project asked by DIO</h2>
    <h3>Purpose:</h3>
    <p>
      Writting with <strong>my words</strong> about the things who was
      presenting until now.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are types of languages who runs on the backend side (server side,
      mostly) and types of language who runs only on client-side (web browers
      mostly).
    </p>
    <p>Languages like that can be <strong>Node JS</strong> as example.</p>

    <p>
      A polemic one, call it <strong> HTML is not a program language</strong> is
      working with <i>tags</i> to change the way the text will be interpreted.
      Not a program langauge with functions, logical programming and other
      concepts.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Tags, Order List, HREF's and more!</h3>
    <p>
      Some tags doesn't have the a pair to close, so their close themsels like
      "img, hr".
    </p>

    <p>
      We can use title on a link to make the cursor show us a little text to
      guide the user where the link is going.
    </p>
    <a href="#init" title="Go to initial page"
      >Click here to see a title working and go back do init of this page!</a
