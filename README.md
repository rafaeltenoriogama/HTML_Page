## Objectives:

The main objective of this HTML page is to demonstrate the creation of a web page using pure HTML and possibly some inline styling, without relying on external CSS files.
Who am I?

I'm **Rafael Tenorio Gama**, a graduate of **IT Management** from Faculdade de Tecnologia de SÃ£o Paulo. My experience includes working with Linux Servers such as Ubuntu, RedHat, and CentOS, as well as Windows Server environments, particularly for data and remote server management at Ambiental Transportes Urbanos S/A.

## Why I do this HTML course on DIO?

I usually work on Django Web projects, which is a Python-based framework. Additionally, I collaborate with teams that utilize low code architecture tools like Scriptcase, based on PHP. Despite my focus on backend development, I feel the need to strengthen my understanding of HTML for comprehensive web development knowledge.
